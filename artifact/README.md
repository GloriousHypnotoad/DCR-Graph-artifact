The source code for 3DCR Explorer can be run from the Unity Editor by performing the following steps:
To install and modify the code, simply add the artifact folder in the Unity Hub.
To view the sample scene double click the file Assets/Scenes/Office_English_Abstract in the Unity Editor. 
Due to copyright restrictions from the unity asset store, only the canonical representation has been included, and the code has been provided without any 3rd party assets. Therefore, anyone wishing to clone and extend the artifact needs to find and import suitable artifacts themselves.
This is most apparent in the game objects used to represent the condtion/milstone relations, i.e. the lock and key objects. These game objects have been replaced with a sphere and a pill-shaped object, respectively.
